## Action Monitoring: The Second Progress Report
* Submission of the report in November 2019
* Feedback on the report in January 2020	

--
>Overall, this Action has made **excellent progress** in its first two years. Its objectives - to create an XML-TEI corpus of multi-lingual nineteenth-century novels, and test distant reading models and practices against that corpus, is **ambitious and timely**. As computational models and techniques of reading (or distant reading) have garnered more scholarly attention, the dominance of Anglophone materials over the dominant exponents is cause for concern. This Action not only **progresses the state-of-the-art** on practices of distant reading, then, it **breaks new ground** in its attention to multi-lingual and cross-lingual texts and methods. What the Action has achieved, in terms of the current ELTeC collections alone, is **remarkable** given the budgetary constraints of COST research networks - it is a real testament to the **commitment of Action members** and the timeliness of the project. **Inventive use of mass dissemination tools and social media** hold the promise of reaching much wider audiences, to engage with hitherto unknown novels as well as distant reading techniques. Its **impact will reach far beyond the timeframe** of the Action.

# Which Publication Platform for ELTeC?

--
## Why another publication platform? 
* Github is great for collaborative data curation
* Zenodo is great for long-term archiving
* However, neither is adapted for delivery to end-users

--
## Requirements 
* Provide overview of collections
* Search and browse with project-specific facets
* Define subcorpora using metadata
* Bulk-download such subcorpora
* Friendly user interface

--
## Candidate plaforms 
* TextGrid Repository (DARIAH-DE)
* LAUDATIO (HU Berlin)
* DraCor (Fischer/Trilcke)
* Omeka (RRCHNM)
* GAMS (ZIM/ACDH Graz)

--
## Pilot with TextGridRep
* see: https://textgridrep.org
* fulfils many requirements (bookshelf, facets) 
* requires extensive data/metadata preparation
* not quite as flexible as we had hoped (metadata for facets)


--
### Search with Facets
![TGR](img/tgr2.png)

--
### Add items to Shelf
![TGR](img/tgr1.png)

--
### Analyze with Voyant
![TGR](img/tgr3.png)


--
## Discussions about DraCor
* see: https://dracor.org 
* fulfils several requirements
* friendly interface
* provides visualizations, SPARQL, API
* would need to be adapted for ELTeC

--
### Overview of corpora
![DraCor](img/dracor3.png)

--
### List view of texts
